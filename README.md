# Nexus

Nexus is a powerful network modeling and analysis tool developed to empower network analysts and designers to create, manipulate, and analyze real-world networks effortlessly. With features like network creation, manipulation, adjacency matrix generation, and Dijkstra's algorithm implementation, Nexus provides users with a comprehensive toolkit for network design and optimization.

## Features

- **Network Creation:** Nexus allows users to create real-world networks with nodes and edges, representing devices and connections, respectively. Users can customize network topology according to their requirements.

- **Manipulation:** Users can manipulate networks by adding, removing, or modifying nodes and edges, enabling them to simulate various network scenarios and configurations.

- **Adjacency Matrix Generation:** Nexus generates an adjacency matrix for the created network, providing users with a structured representation of node connectivity for further analysis.

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm (Shortest Path First):** The system includes an implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm, allowing users to find the shortest path between nodes within the network, facilitating efficient routing and network optimization.

- **User Management:** Nexus features user management functionality, allowing users to register accounts and save their created networks in the cloud for later retrieval. Users can also export entire networks as JSON files for external use or sharing.

## Why Nexus?

- **Versatility:** Nexus caters to the diverse needs of network analysts and designers, offering a range of tools for network creation, manipulation, and analysis in a single platform.

- **Efficiency:** With features like adjacency matrix generation and Dijkstra's algorithm implementation, Nexus streamlines network analysis processes, saving time and effort for users.

- **Collaboration:** The user management system enables collaboration among team members by allowing them to save and share network configurations, fostering teamwork and knowledge sharing.
